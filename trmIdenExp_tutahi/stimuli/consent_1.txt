<h3 id = "consentForm">Invitation to Participate and Description of Project </h3>
<p id = "consentForm">Hello, we are a research team based at the University of Auckland and firstly we would like to thank you for expressing your interest in participating our study. The research is funded by the Royal Society of New Zealand, under the Marsden Fast-Start grant.</p>

<h3 id = "consentForm">Purpose of research</h3>
<p id = "consentForm">The aim of this project is to identify acoustic cues that are important to understand sounds of te reo Māori in our daily acoustic environments. </p> 

<h3 id = "consentForm">Description of the Procedure</h3>
<ol id = "consentForm">

  <li>Speech perception test: Here, you will be asked to listen to some speech-like sounds and answer questions on these sounds on the computer. 
  For example, we may ask you to select the sound or word you heard from the options on the screen. </li>
  <li>Demographics Questionnaire: Here, you will be asked questions such as language background, iwi information, education and age. In addition, there will be questions on your language learning experiences. These questions are intended to understand the nature of the participants doing this study, as these aspects are known to affect speech perception. 
  You may also be asked about how you found the study.</li>

</ol>

<h3 id = "consentForm">Confidentiality</h3>
<p id = "consentForm">Your name will not be recorded and, therefore, will not appear in subsequent scholarly presentations or publications. Other personal information gathered in this study will not be disclosed to any persons other than the investigators and their collaborators. Furthermore, effort will be made to keep this information secure and to destroy it once the results of the study have been published. Following the standard practice in linguistics research, recorded linguistic data, however, will not be disposed (unless by specific request of the participant), as its preservation is necessary for further studies involving wider samples of speakers or for studies examining linguistic change over time.</p>

<h3 id = "consentForm">Voluntary Participation</h3>
<p id = "consentForm">You are free to choose not to participate, and, if you do become a participant, you are free to withdraw from the experiment at any time during its course, by clicking away from the website. Due to the anonymous nature of the experiment, you will not be able to withdraw after you have completed the experiment. Should you terminate your participation, you may do so without jeopardizing any of the following that may apply to you, namely, any opportunities to serve as a participant in future experiments or your standing as a student if you are a student.</p>
